# PROJECT STATE

latest_session: S001
phase: Phase 1 complete (tick history MVP shipped). Phase 2 = refinement, gated on live validation.
status: active

## Current Focus

MVP shipped in S001: tick-by-tick PvP combat history overlay (B001-B007). Build green,
5 unit tests pass, jar auto-installs to ~/.runelite/sideloaded-plugins.
NEXT: live validation via HT-001..HT-004. Then Phase 2 (B008 NEXT UP — grow AnimationStyleMap).

## Open Threads

- Live validation pending (HT-001..HT-004). MVP behaviour unconfirmed in a real fight.
- AnimationStyleMap is a small seed; unmapped attack anims log at debug for B008.

## Known Issues

none confirmed (no live run yet).

## Architecture Notes

Code exists now. Layering:
- PvpEnhancerPlugin (root pkg) — @PluginDescriptor entry point, owns all @Subscribe handlers,
  only class coupled to live Client/ItemManager. Translates events → model.CombatEvent → service.
- service.TickHistoryService — @Singleton, pure buffer (pending list + capped newest-first Deque),
  unit-tested without a client.
- model.* — immutable event/data classes + AnimationStyleMap seed.
- overlay.TickHistoryOverlay — OverlayPanel, read-only view of the service.

Build: Gradle 8.10 wrapper committed. `compileOnly net.runelite:client:latest.release`,
release 11. `./gradlew run` = dev loop (launches RuneLite). `./gradlew build` = compile +
test + auto-install jar to sideloaded-plugins.

API gotchas (do not relearn):
- Client has NO getItemComposition(int). Use injected ItemManager.getItemComposition(int).
- OverlayPriority enum removed on current API — set position only, never setPriority.
- equipment id decode: raw >= 512 → item id = raw - 512.
